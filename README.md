# Heimdallm

> AI-powered GitHub automation for macOS and Linux — reviews your pull requests, triages your issues, and can even open implementation PRs for you. Uses Claude, Gemini, Codex, or OpenCode under the hood, posts everything back as your GitHub account, and keeps you informed via a native menu-bar app or a SvelteKit web UI.

## What it does

Heimdallm runs in the background and does three things, in parallel, at your configured poll interval:

### 1. PR reviews
Watches the PRs where you're requested as a reviewer, runs an AI code review, and submits it to GitHub as your account. No copy-pasting, no manual prompting.

### 2. Issue triage & auto-implement
Fetches issues from monitored repos, classifies them by label (`review_only` vs `auto_implement` vs `skip`), and for the develop-track ones optionally **creates a branch, commits the change, and opens a PR** against your default branch — fully autonomous on the issues you mark for it.

### 3. Self-monitoring UI
A SvelteKit web dashboard (`:3000`) with Dashboard, PR list, Issue list, prompt/agent editor, live config editor, and a live log stream. Opens alongside the daemon in Docker mode.

### Headline features

- **Automatic reviews** — polls `review-requested:@me` on GitHub and submits reviews as your account
- **Issue pipeline** — label-driven triage + optional auto-implement with branch/commit/PR cycle
- **Configurable prompts** — general review, security audit, performance, architecture, or your own with `{diff}` `{title}` `{author}` `{comments}` placeholders, managed from the web UI at `/agents`
- **Two feedback modes** — *single* (one consolidated review) or *multi* (one GitHub comment per issue + summary), globally and per repo
- **Per-repo overrides** — different AI agent, prompt, and feedback mode per repository
- **Topic-based auto-discovery** — tag repos with a GitHub topic and Heimdallm monitors them without editing config
- **Severity gating** — only `high` severity triggers `REQUEST_CHANGES`; everything else approves with informational notes
- **Native desktop** — macOS menu-bar app, system notifications, dark mode, no Electron
- **Web UI** — SvelteKit dashboard with system / light / dark theme toggle, live SSE updates
- **Docker mode** — single `make up` spins up daemon + web UI for server/team deployments

## Installation

### macOS (DMG)

1. Download `Heimdallm-vX.Y.Z.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/theburrowhub/heimdallm/releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag **Heimdallm** to **Applications**
3. Open Terminal and run once:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/Heimdallm.app
   ```
4. Double-click Heimdallm in Applications

> **Requires**: macOS 13+ (Apple Silicon or Intel), `gh` CLI authenticated (`gh auth login`).

### Linux

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/theburrowhub/heimdallm/releases) and install for your distro:

| Package | Distros | Command |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `.deb` | Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Pop!\_OS | `sudo dpkg -i heimdallm_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb` |
| `.rpm` | Fedora, RHEL, openSUSE | `sudo rpm -i heimdallm-X.Y.Z-1.x86_64.rpm` |
| `.AppImage` | Arch, NixOS, any distro | `chmod +x Heimdallm-X.Y.Z-x86_64.AppImage && ./Heimdallm-X.Y.Z-x86_64.AppImage` |

Installs to `/opt/heimdallm/` with a desktop entry and `/usr/bin/heimdallm` symlink.

> **Requires**: `gh` CLI authenticated (`gh auth login`). Token stored via GNOME Keyring / KDE Wallet (`secret-tool`), or `~/.config/heimdallm/.token` as fallback.

### Docker

For headless/server deployment, Heimdallm runs as a Docker container with all four AI CLIs bundled. The repository ships Make wrappers around `docker compose` so you don't have to remember the compose path.

#### 1. Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** (or Docker Engine + compose plugin) running.
- A **GitHub personal access token** with `repo` scope (or `public_repo` for public-only). Create one at https://github.com/settings/tokens.
- An **API key for your chosen AI provider** — at least one of:
  - Claude: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys (or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` via `claude setup-token`)
  - Gemini: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
  - OpenAI / Codex: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
  - OpenRouter (for OpenCode): https://openrouter.ai/keys

#### 2. Configure

```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
# Edit docker/.env — at minimum fill in:
#   GITHUB_TOKEN
#   HEIMDALLM_AI_PRIMARY      (claude | gemini | codex | opencode)
#   <provider>_API_KEY        (matching your primary)
#   HEIMDALLM_REPOSITORIES    (owner/repo1,owner/repo2 — or leave empty if
#                              using HEIMDALLM_DISCOVERY_TOPIC)
```

See [`docker/.env.example`](docker/.env.example) for every supported variable including issue-tracking, topic-based discovery, and web UI settings.

#### 3. Start the stack

```bash
make up            # daemon + web UI (recommended)
# or:
make up-daemon     # daemon only, no web UI
```

`make up` refuses to start if `docker/.env` is missing and prints the exact copy-from-template command. The web container waits for the daemon's healthcheck before accepting traffic, so the first UI request never races a half-initialised daemon.

#### 4. Verify

```bash
make ps                          # show container status
curl http://localhost:7842/health  # -> {"status":"ok"}
```

Then open the web UI:

- macOS: `open http://localhost:3000`
- Linux: `xdg-open http://localhost:3000`
- Or browse to `http://localhost:3000` manually.

The `web` container reads the daemon's API token from the shared `heimdallm-data` volume automatically — no manual copy needed.

#### 5. Day-to-day commands

```bash
make logs          # tail logs from daemon + web
make logs-daemon   # daemon only
make restart       # restart both containers
make down          # stop and remove containers (data volume persists)
make setup         # (optional) copy the daemon API token into docker/.env.
                   #  Only needed if you want to call the daemon's HTTP API
                   #  from outside Docker (scripts, CI, `curl` from the host).
                   #  The web UI does NOT need this — it reads the token from
                   #  the shared volume automatically.
```

The Docker image is published to `ghcr.io/theburrowhub/heimdallm:latest` on every release — `make up` pulls it automatically when the `build:` contexts haven't changed locally.

#### Reusing your host's AI authentication

If you already authenticate the AI CLIs on your host, you can reuse those
credentials inside Docker instead of pasting an API key into `.env`. The
daemon runs its **own** bundled CLIs inside the container — it never shells
out to the binaries on your host — but the container can read the same
OAuth tokens the host CLIs wrote.

**Claude Code (Max / Pro / Team subscription):**

1. On your host, run once:
   ```bash
   claude setup-token
   ```
   Copy the long-lived token it prints.
2. Add it to `docker/.env`:
   ```
   CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=<paste token>
   ```
   Leave `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` empty. `docker-compose.yml` already forwards
   `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` into the container.
3. Do **not** set `bare = true` in `config.toml` — it disables OAuth and
   forces API-key mode.

**Gemini CLI (browser OAuth):**

1. Authenticate `gemini` on your host the normal way. Credentials land in
   `~/.gemini/`.
2. In `docker/docker-compose.yml`, uncomment the line under the `heimdallm`
   service's `volumes:` block:
   ```yaml
   - ~/.gemini:/home/heimdallm/.gemini:ro
   ```
   The mount is read-only, so the container cannot clobber your host
   credentials.
3. Leave `GEMINI_API_KEY` empty in `docker/.env`.

**Codex / OpenCode:** host-auth reuse is not wired up yet — use API keys
(`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) in `docker/.env`.

`make up` picks up the changes on the next start. Full reference (including
Vertex AI service-account mode for Gemini) in
[`docs/e2e-test-guide.md`](docs/e2e-test-guide.md).

#### Auto-discover repositories by topic

Instead of listing every repository in `HEIMDALLM_REPOSITORIES`, you can tag
the repos you want Heimdallm to watch with a GitHub **topic** and let the
daemon discover them:

```bash
HEIMDALLM_DISCOVERY_TOPIC=heimdallm-review
HEIMDALLM_DISCOVERY_ORGS=your-org,your-other-org   # required
HEIMDALLM_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL=15m                    # optional, defaults to 15m
```

Any non-archived repo inside one of the listed orgs that carries the topic is
merged into the monitored set on each discovery cycle. Transient Search API
errors fall back to the last known-good list, so an outage never empties the
set silently. The static `HEIMDALLM_REPOSITORIES` list keeps working — the
two sources are merged (deduplicated) at poll time.

### Automated install (for agents / scripts)

See [LLM-HOW-TO-INSTALL.md](LLM-HOW-TO-INSTALL.md) for a step-by-step guide suitable for Claude Code, shell scripts, or any automation tool.

On first launch Heimdallm detects your `gh` CLI token automatically and sets itself up.

## Architecture

The **Go daemon** (`heimdalld`, port `7842`) is the engine. It polls GitHub for PRs and issues, dispatches work to the configured AI CLI, posts reviews or opens implementation PRs, and broadcasts state to any connected UI over SSE.

Two first-party UIs talk to it over HTTP:

- **Flutter desktop app** — macOS menu-bar + dashboard, system notifications. Ships inside the `.dmg` / Linux packages.
- **SvelteKit web UI** — browser dashboard on port `3000`, ships as a second Docker container alongside the daemon.

```
Flutter app ─┐
             ├──→ HTTP / SSE ──→  heimdalld  ──→  GitHub API
Web UI     ──┘                       │
                                     ├──→  PR review pipeline   ──→  POST /reviews
                                     ├──→  Issue triage pipeline
                                     └──→  Auto-implement       ──→  branch + commits + PR
                                                 │
                                      claude / gemini / codex / opencode CLI
```

In **Docker mode** the daemon runs standalone with the web UI container as an optional-but-recommended companion (brought up by default with `make up`). Configuration is via environment variables (`HEIMDALLM_*`) or a mounted `config.toml`, and can be edited live from the web UI at `/config`.

---

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Flutter 3.x (stable)
- `gh` CLI authenticated
- macOS 13+ with Xcode **or** Linux with GTK 3 dev libraries

### Running locally

Two workflows — pick based on what you're changing:

**Flutter desktop app or daemon Go code** — native toolchain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theburrowhub/heimdallm && cd heimdallm
make dev          # builds daemon + launches Flutter app in debug mode
```
`make dev` compiles the daemon, embeds it, and launches the Flutter app with `HEIMDALLM_DAEMON_PATH` pointing to the local binary. First run detects your `gh` token and writes `~/.config/heimdallm/config.toml`.

**Web UI or Docker deployment** — containerised:
```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env    # fill in GITHUB_TOKEN + provider key
make up                                # daemon + web UI
make logs                              # follow both services
```
For iterating on the SvelteKit code with HMR against a running daemon:
```bash
cd web_ui
npm install
HEIMDALLM_API_URL=http://localhost:7842 \
HEIMDALLM_API_TOKEN=$(docker compose -f ../docker/docker-compose.yml exec -T heimdallm cat /data/api_token) \
npm run dev
```

### Other targets

```bash
make test          # Run Go + Flutter test suites on the host
make test-docker   # Run Go tests inside a pinned Docker image (EDR-safe)
make dev-daemon    # Run daemon only (debug API at localhost:7842)
make dev-stop      # Stop the running daemon
make up            # Docker: bring up daemon + web UI
make up-daemon     # Docker: daemon only
make down          # Docker: stop and remove containers
make logs          # Docker: follow all services
make restart       # Docker: bounce both containers
make ps            # Docker: container status
make setup         # Docker: copy daemon API token into docker/.env (optional)
make release-local # Build signed + notarized DMG and publish GitHub release
```

## Releasing

```bash
# Automatic version bump from conventional commits
# (Actions → "Tag release" → Run workflow)

# Or manually
make release-local VERSION=v1.2.3
```

The `tag.yml` workflow analyses commits since the last tag:
- `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE` → major bump
- `feat:` → minor bump
- `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc. → patch bump

Pushing the tag triggers `build.yml`, which builds, signs, notarizes (if Developer ID configured), and publishes the DMG to GitHub Releases.

Alternatively, **release-please** (via `release.yml`) automates this: it reads conventional commits, opens a Release PR with changelog, and on merge creates the tag + GitHub Release. This also triggers the Docker image build and push to `ghcr.io/theburrowhub/heimdallm`.
